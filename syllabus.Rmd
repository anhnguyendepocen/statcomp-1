# Syllabus

### Objective and description

This class teaches important concepts and skills for statistical
computing, numerical optimization, and machine learning using case
studies. After this course, students will have a good understanding of
the process of producing high-quality and sharable statistical
programs, algorithms for optimization and numerical integration, and
will be able to implement and apply some common and powerful machine
learning methods.

### Content

In this class, students will learn:

* How to write efficient and sharable statistical programs for scientific research
* Various optimization and numerical integration algorithms
* How to implement and use common and powerful machine learning methods

### Prerequisites - strictly enforced

* {[BIOS 660, 661, 662, 663](https://sph.unc.edu/bios/courses/)} or {[BCB 720](http://catalog.unc.edu/courses/bcb/)}
* One programming class at the undergraduate level or [BIOS 611](https://biodatascience.github.io/datasci611/)
* Prior R experience is required, familiarity with [basic R functions](https://github.com/biodatascience/compbio_src/blob/master/eda/functions.md)
* Basic knowledge of the Linux environment

### Similar classes

* [BIOS 611 - Introduction to Data Science](https://biodatascience.github.io/datasci611/)
* [BIOS 651 - Principles of Machine Learning](https://sph.unc.edu/bios/courses/)

### Instructors

* Coordinating instructor: Naim Rashid
* Co-instructors: Michael Love and Yuchao Jiang (alternate years)

### Graded work
 
The class will be taught through three modules. Two projects (25%
each), a final presentation (20%), and weekly homework assignments
(30% total) will make up the final grade for the course.

At the beginning of the course, students will learn to create an R
package which they will update as the class progresses, implementing
the methods they learn in each module. This R package will be
applied to each project and homework assignment. Each student's R
package will be hosted and iteratively updated on GitHub. Homework
and projects will be similarly submitted to course instructors through
GitHub Classrooms.

Grading scale:

* H: Clear excellence
* P: Entirely satisfactory
* L: Low passing
* F: Fail

The School of Public Health grading system is designed so that the
mode of the grading distribution is P. The last graded assignment will
be due on the last week of regular classes.
